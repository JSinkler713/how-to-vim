// Here's an example of how you could edit everything inside the ()

// We have a function with 1 param, which we want to edit

const sumTwoNums = (num1, num2) => {
  return num1 + num2
}

// to edit what's in the parenthesis we can use the following commands
//  5gg  this will bring us to line 5
//  f(  this will get us to opening parenthesis
//  ci(  this will cut what is within the parenthesis() and put us in insert mode to replace with what we want
